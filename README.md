Welcome to my profile! My name is **Archie Boswell**. During my mathematics degree, I completed several data science projects, many of which are available in my GitHub repositories and worth exploring. Since graduating, I’ve worked as a data consultant at The Information Lab for over two years, developing strong expertise in data visualisation and data manipulation. Most recently, I’ve begun transitioning into data engineering, expanding my skills and knowledge in this area.
